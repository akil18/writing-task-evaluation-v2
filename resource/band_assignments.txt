- 7:

    Task Achievement:
    The response covers the requirements of the task.
    The content is relevant and accurate â€“ there may be a few omissions or lapses.
    The format is appropriate.
    (Academic) Key features which are selected are covered and clearly
    highlighted but could be more fully or more appropriately illustrated or
    extended.
    (Academic) It presents a clear overview, the data are appropriately
    categorised, and main trends or differences are identified.
    (General Training) All bullet points are covered and clearly highlighted but

    a clear purpose. The tone is consistent and appropriate to the task. Any lapses
    are minimal.

    Coherence & Cohesion:
    Information and ideas are logically
    organised and there is a clear progression
    throughout the response. A few lapses
    may occur.
    A range of cohesive devices including

    flexibility and precision.
    There is some ability to use less common
    and/or idiomatic items.
    An awareness of style and collocation is
    evident, though inappropriacies occur.
    There are only a few errors in spelling and/or

    A variety of complex structures is used with
    some flexibility and accuracy.
    Grammar and punctuation are generally well
    controlled, and error-free sentences are
    frequent.
    A few errors in grammar may persist, but
    these do not impede communication.


- 6:

    Task Achievement:
    The response focuses on the requirements of the task and an appropriate
    format is used.
    (Academic) Key features which are selected are covered and adequately
    highlighted. A relevant overview is attempted. Information is appropriately
    selected and supported using figures/data.
    (General Training) All bullet points are covered and adequately
    highlighted. The purpose is generally clear. There may be minor
    inconsistencies in tone.
    Some irrelevant, inappropriate or inaccurate information may occur in
    areas of detail or when illustrating or extending the main points.
    Some details may be missing (or excessive) and further extension or
    illustration may be needed.

    Coherence & Cohesion:
    Information and ideas are generally
    arranged coherently and there is a clear
    overall progression.
    Cohesive devices are used to some good
    effect but cohesion within and/or
    between sentences may be faulty or
    mechanical due to misuse, overuse or
    omission.
    The use of reference and substitution
    may lack flexibility or clarity and result in
    some repetition or error

    Lexical Resource:
    The resource is generally adequate and
    appropriate for the task.
    The meaning is generally clear in spite of a
    rather restricted range or a lack of
    precision in word choice.
    If the writer is a risk-taker, there will be a
    wider range of vocabulary used but higher
    degrees of inaccuracy or inappropriacy.
    There are some errors in spelling and/or
    word formation, but these do not impede
    communication.

    Grammatical Range & Accuracy:
    A mix of simple and complex sentence
    forms is used but flexibility is limited.
    Examples of more complex structures are
    not marked by the same level of accuracy
    as in simple structures.
    Errors in grammar and punctuation occur,
    but rarely impede communication


- 5:

    Task Achievement:
    The response generally addresses the requirements of the task. The
    format may be inappropriate in places.
    (Academic) Key features which are selected are not adequately covered.
    The recounting of detail is mainly mechanical. There may be no data to
    support the description.
    (General Training) All bullet points are presented but one or more may not
    be adequately covered. The purpose may be unclear at times. The tone
    may be variable and sometimes inappropriate.
    There may be a tendency to focus on details (without referring to the
    bigger picture).
    The inclusion of irrelevant, inappropriate or inaccurate material in key
    areas detracts from the task achievement.
    There is limited detail when extending and illustrating the main points.

    Coherence & Cohesion:
    Organisation is evident but is not wholly
    logical and there may be a lack of overall
    progression. Nevertheless, there is a
    sense of underlying coherence to the
    response.
    The relationship of ideas can be followed
    but the sentences are not fluently linked
    to each other.
    There may be limited/overuse of cohesive
    devices with some inaccuracy.
    The writing may be repetitive due to
    inadequate and/or inaccurate use of
    reference and substitution.

    Lexical Resource:
    The resource is limited but minimally
    adequate for the task.
    Simple vocabulary may be used accurately
    but the range does not permit much
    variation in expression.
    There may be frequent lapses in
    the appropriacy of word choice, and a lack
    of flexibility is apparent in frequent
    simplifications and/or repetitions.
    Errors in spelling and/or word formation
    may be noticeable and may cause some
    difficulty for the reader.

    Grammatical Range & Accuracy:
    The range of structures is limited and
    rather repetitive.
    Although complex sentences are
    attempted, they tend to be faulty, and the
    greatest accuracy is achieved on simple
    sentences.
    Grammatical errors may be frequent and
    cause some difficulty for the reader.
    Punctuation may be faulty.


- 4:

    Task Achievement:
    The response is an attempt to address the task.
    (Academic) Few key features have been selected.
    (General Training) Not all bullet points are presented.
    (General Training) The purpose of the letter is not clearly explained and may
    be confused. The tone may be inappropriate.
    The format may be inappropriate.
    Key features/bullet points which are presented may be irrelevant, repetitive,
    inaccurate or inappropriate.

    Coherence & Cohesion:
    Information and ideas are evident but not
    arranged coherently, and there is no clear
    progression within the response.
    Relationships between ideas can be unclear
    and/or inadequately marked. There is some
    use of basic cohesive devices, which may be
    inaccurate or repetitive.
    There is inaccurate use or a lack of
    substitution or referencing.

    Lexical Resource:
    The resource is limited and inadequate for
    or unrelated to the task. Vocabulary is basic and
    may be used repetitively.
    There may be inappropriate use of lexical chunks
    (e.g. memorised phrases, formulaic language
    and/or language from the input material).
    Inappropriate word choice and/or errors in word
    formation and/or in spelling may impede
    meaning.

    Grammatical Range & Accuracy:
    A very limited range of structures is
    used.
    Subordinate clauses are rare and
    simple sentences predominate.
    Some structures are produced accurately
    but grammatical errors are frequent and
    may impede meaning.
    Punctuation is often faulty or inadequate.


- 3:

    Task Achievement:
    The response does not address the requirements of the task (possibly because
    of misunderstanding of the data/diagram/situation).
    Key features/bullet points which are presented may be largely irrelevant.
    Limited information is presented, and this may be used repetitively.

    Coherence & Cohesion:
    There is no apparent logical organisation.
    Ideas are discernible but difficult to relate
    to each other.
    Minimal use of sequencers or cohesive
    devices. Those used do not necessarily
    indicate a logical relationship between
    ideas.
    There is difficulty in identifying referencing.

    Lexical Resource:
    The resource is inadequate (which may be due to
    the response being significantly underlength).
    Possible over-dependence on input material or
    memorised language.
    Control of word choice and/or spelling is very
    limited, and errors predominate. These errors may
    severely impede meaning.

    Grammatical Range & Accuracy:
    Sentence forms are attempted, but
    errors in grammar and punctuation
    predominate (except in memorised
    phrases or those taken from the input
    material). This prevents most meaning
    from coming through.
    Length may be insufficient to provide
    evidence of control of sentence forms.


- 2:

    Task Achievement:
    The content barely relates to the task.

    Coherence & Cohesion:
    There is little relevant message, or the
    entire response may be off-topic.

    The resource is extremely limited with few
    recognisable strings, apart from memorised
    phrases.
    There is no apparent control of word formation
    and/or spelling.

    Grammatical Range & Accuracy:
    There is little or no evidence of sentence
    forms (except in memorised phrases).

    Responses of 20 words or fewer are rated at
    Band 1.
    No resource is apparent, except for a few isolated
    words.
